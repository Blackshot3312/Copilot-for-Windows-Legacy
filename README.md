> Ensure the NuGet package CefSharp.WPF is installed in your VS
> 
> Compilation is simple and works for both 32-bit and 64-bit

## Questions & Answers:
**Q: Is this an official Microsoft product?**
A: Copilot itself is official, but the program is independently developed. However, all functions—such as account management—are handled through Microsoft’s website.

**Q: Is it compatible with Windows 10 and 11?**
A: Yes, but I don’t see much reason to install it since Windows already has built-in support.

**Q: Can I install it on Windows Vista or older?**
A: No, it runs on .NET 4.7, but it's not entirely impossible to make it work—at least on Vista. As for XP, I wouldn’t bet on it.

**Q: Can I modify the elements within the AI?**
A: Unfortunately, no. Those are managed by Microsoft’s website. However, I plan to completely recreate the program, so feel free to experiment. As you can see from the code, it's quite a simple program.
